For some reason It's not letting me upload my zipped raster datasets. They are each only around 70,000KB so i don't know why I'm having a problem. 

These are the same datasets I uploaded for Challenge 4, so I should be able to upload them. Until I get this sorted out, the data used in the code can be found under coding challenge 4.
